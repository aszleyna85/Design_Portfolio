# 🏗️ Design Portfolio (CAD & GIS Projects)

## 🧠 Problem
Engineering and telecom projects require accurate CAD/GIS designs to ensure continuity, accuracy, and reliable network deployment.  
This portfolio section demonstrates my experience across **AutoCAD, GIS, and analog design tools**.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- AutoCAD (Basic, Electrical, Map 3D)
- Bentley Microstation
- Cadence Virtuoso

## 📂 Projects

### 🔌 Voltage Regulator Circuit (Smart Battery)
- Tool: AutoCAD Electrical
- Designed portion of smart battery schematic (components modified for confidentiality).
- Ensured stable regulated voltage for sensitive electronics.

### 🌐 FTTx Fiber Schematic
- Tool: AutoCAD Basic
- Updated fiber network schematics.
- Verified fiber continuity and identified unused/damaged ports.

### 🗺️ GIS Fiber Route Updates
- Tool: AutoCAD Map 3D
- Mapped fiber routes from hub to endpoint with geolocation precision.
- Improved data accuracy for field engineers.

### 🏗️ Structure Map for Network Migration
- Tool: Bentley Microstation
- Updated positional accuracy of structures (poles, pedestals).
- Supported seamless migration into unified GIS system.

### 🔬 Analog Design (Postgraduate Dissertation)
- Tool: Cadence Virtuoso
- Designed and simulated a Ring Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO).
- Tuned W/L ratios and verified stable frequency output.
